( There were no pull requests, just a couple of pushes to main, which included the last semester's game files including Christian Henken's features. Christian Hernandez made no pull request to main yet, but he will next sprint, as he needs to publish his features to the github. The reason there were no pull requests is because this is a new github repo (previous github owner left the project). )
